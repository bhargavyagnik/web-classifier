# web-classifier
Web page Classifier using the DMOZ data.
I have used a Naive Bayes classifier for this project.
But i recommend someone using CNN for this as it would give you an accuracy upto 97-99%
This is the classification report obtained in my case. 
micro avg     0.82    0.82    0.82    239171
macro avg     0.76    0.81    0.78    239171
weighted avg    0.83    0.82    0.82    239171
