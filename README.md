Web page Classifier using the DMOZ data.

(update) The DMOZ site is now in archive and hence you wont find the dataset . Although you may get it at Kaggle [Kaggle DMOZ dataset with 5 classes only](https://www.kaggle.com/shawon10/url-classification-dataset-dmoz/version/2?select=dmoz.csv) or you can use the DMOZ dataset that i had on my PC. [DMOZ dataset with 12 classes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EaieHk05sdYpQpA3xIJCDy99qleoBs7p)

So this was my first project in Machine learning where i had to classify webpage by extracting text from the internet and predicting from the 12 classes. 
This comes under the hood of NLP.
